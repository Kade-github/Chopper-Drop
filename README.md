## Functionality & FAQ
**How does this work? You might ask, well heres how.**
<br>Every 10 minutes (by default) it calls a chopper, when it lands (where MTF spawns) it will spawn in all the items you configured! 5 minutes later (by default) a Chaos Insurgency car will spawn and deliver a supply drop.

<details>
<summary>FAQ - Please read.</summary>

#### How does the chance system work with quantity higher than 1?
> Chance is calculated for every item that will spawn, not item type. If you have 5 medkits with 20% chance, each one will have a 20% chance to spawn. Set the `debug` option to `true` to see how it works.

#### How to give 3 `X` with 100% chance and 2 `X` with 20% chance?
> Simple, just add two fields with the same item name, but different chance and quantity.

#### How to disable one of the drops?
> For Chaos Insurgency set the `time_difference` value to a very high one.
> For MTF use the `chopper_time` value instead.

#### How to get rid of the time difference between chopper and car?
> Set the `time_difference` value to `1`. Not `-1`, not `0`, just `1`.

#### How to get coordinates for the spawn?
> Use RemoteAdmin coordinates. How? Just request player data, its in XYZ order.

#### Why such a complicated coordinates system?
> Well, I've heard complains that items fly away if you spawn a big pile of them so I wanted to change that, and this is the best system I believe. I made sure that default values will be the best so you don't have to mess with that.
